      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Auva Amirmokri! I'm passionate about teaching, technology, and the environment, and love to explore the
        intersectionality of the three. Computer Science student at the University of Maryland. 
        I love coding and exploring the latest technologies. I love web development and backend development,
        specifically in Java and JS. I also just graduated early from the University of Maryland in December, earning my degree in 
        Computer Science and minoring in Sustainability Studies!
        <br> My other interests include analog photography, traveling, playing/watching soccer, exploring nature, 
        painting/drawing, and spending time with animals!
